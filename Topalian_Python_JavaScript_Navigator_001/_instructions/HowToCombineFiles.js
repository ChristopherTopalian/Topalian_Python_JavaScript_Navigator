We can combine all of the .py files
that are located in our py folder
into one main.py file, using:
    The Command Prompt Method
    or
    The .bat File Method
    or
    The Python Script Method
    or
    The Node.js Script Method

The .bat file method is very easy.
We double click the bat file, which is located in our py folder, and it will make a main.py file, which includes all .py files in the py folder, including all .py files in all subdirectories of our py folder.

This is a very easy way to combine our .py files, because we can double click the .bat file anytime, and it will again generate the main.py file, which includes all .py files in the py folder, including all .py files in all subdirectories of our py folder.

Now that all of our code is in one file we can easily paste it into a book to teach the world our code.

The same is true if we choose to use the Python Script Method or the Node.js Method for combining scripts.
We put the script in our py folder and then activate it.
This easily combines files making it easy to share our code with the world :-)

Note: Combining JS files can be done using the scripts found in the folder named _combineJS.

Note: Combining PY files can be done using the scripts found in the folder named _combinePY.

Happy Scripting :-)
